# VCV Rack Recorder


This is a clone of [dekstop Recorder](https://github.com/dekstop/vcvrackplugins_dekstop)
modded so I can record using a trigger.
It will create a new file for every recording.

Useful for Sampling an instrument.

> This Module is quite fragile. I hacked it because I needed a functionality like it.

# How it works

The Trigger input starts recording and stops recording.

Before recording can start you have to click the button above the `0000` and choose a file name (without suffix).
